# Changelog

## v1.6
- **Fix Grizzl-E Duo port 2 reporting** ([#23](https://github.com/mclare/grizzl_e-for-HA/issues/23)). The Duo does not report its second cable through `curMeas2`/`voltMeas2` (those are per-phase fields that stay `0`). Cable 2 now reads current from `curMeas1C2`, voltage from the shared `voltMeas1`, and power from `powerMeas2`.
    - Added a `port_key()` mapping helper in `const.py` that resolves each per-cable measurement to the correct JSON key for a given port.
    - Multi-port units now expose Power, Current, Voltage, Session Energy, Total Energy, Session Time, Session Money, State and Pilot State **per cable** (previously only Current/Voltage were per-port and everything else was cable-1 only). Binary sensors (Session Started, Pilot Connected) are now per cable too.
    - Port 1 keeps its original entity `unique_id`s, so existing single-port setups keep their history. Port 2+ get disambiguated ids.
    - Enum sensors (State, Pilot State) no longer carry an invalid `measurement` state class.
    - Added regression tests using the real Duo payloads from issue #23.

## v1.0
- First full release!
- **Breaking changes from pre-release versions**: the domain has changed from `grizzl-e` to `grizzl_e` to match some of the restricted namespaces across Home Assistant/HACS. This will require a reinstallation of the integration.
    - Updated manifest.json: DOMAIN = "grizzl_e"
    - Renamed integration directory: custom_components/grizzl-e/ becomes custom_components/grizzl_e/
    - Updated const.py: DOMAIN = "grizzl_e" to match manifest.json
    - Fixed config_flow.py: async_step_user now forwards to async_step_connection(user_input) to resolve “Invalid handler specified”
    - Updated strings.json: Added entries for connection and ports steps and error keys used by the flow
- There is now a grizzle_e entry in Home Assistants' Brands repository, and the integration will be submitted to HACS.

## v0.3.0
- Mostly changes to terminology and instructions in README, as well as adding troubleshooting information.
- Added HACS validation script, and updated hacs.json.
- A PR has been submitted to https://github.com/home-assistant/brands to get logos etc

## v0.2.0
- Clean HACS items like manifest.json
- Remove look-a-like icons to transition to https://github.com/home-assistant/brands

## v0.1.0
- Initial release!


## [Unreleased] - January 2026
Thanks to everyone for their enthusiasm and guidance!

### Community Contributions
 - Call out in r/evcharging/ got me going again. Thanks folks https://www.reddit.com/r/evcharging/comments/1o524on/comment/nywjtup/
 - HACS file structure refinements and home assistant version backwards compatibility information provided by https://github.com/lukavia
 - Change to Total Energy sensor to have it work with HA Energy dashboard, from issue https://github.com/mclare/grizzl_e-for-HA/issues/2 submitted by https://github.com/drasch

### Added
- Basic pytest tests

 ### Changed
- Reuse HA’s shared aiohttp session and per-request timeout in init.py
    - Use async_get_clientsession(hass) and an aiohttp.ClientTimeout on the request via session.post(..., timeout=timeout).
    - Remove the unused outer ClientSession and storage in hass.data.
    - No longer creating a new session in each update
- Applied options to coordinator and register options flow correctly in config_flow.py
    - Made async_get_options_flow a static method.
-  Fix platform setup early returns in sensor.py and binary_sensor.py
    - Replace return False with just return.

### Minor cleanups
- Remove the stray docstring line in GrizzleESensor.
- Standardize DeviceInfo import to from homeassistant.helpers.entity import DeviceInfo across files for consistency.

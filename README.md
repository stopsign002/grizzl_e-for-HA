A Home Assistant integration for Grizzl-E EVSEs (Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment, or charger), providing sensors for monitoring the WiFi Grizzl-E EVSEs.

This integration works with most WiFi enabled Grizzl-E chargers (the Connect and Ultimate lines) but does not work with chargers enrolled in the "Grizzl-E Club" or comercial chargers.

This integration is not affiliated with United Chargers or Grizzl-E (but is also made in Ontario, Canada). Please consult [United Charger's User Manuals](https://grizzl-e.com/user-manuals) can learn more about operating Grizzl-E EVSE.



## ⚠️ Security Note
Did you know that your United Chargers Grizzl-E WiFi enabled EVSE has a web interface that is by default unauthenticated? If you haven't visited the Grizzl-E web interface, referred to in the user manuals as [Page Access](https://ecommerce-space.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/Operation_Manual_V4_0_d5c730c075.pdf#Grizzl-EUltimate_OperationManual_V4.0.indd%3AAnchor%203%3A3092), and set a password, you should do that right away. This integration assumes a username and password has been set.

Even once a username and password is set, users should ensure that thier EVSE is properly secured on their network from the rest of the internet.

## Features

This integration provides the following features:
- Real-time monitoring of charging status and metrics
- Support for multiple Grizzl-E  models
- Configurable polling interval
- Temperature monitoring
- Energy usage tracking

2. Click "+ Add Integration"
3. Search for "Grizzl-E EV "
4. Enter your 's IP address or hostname
5. Enter the username and password (default is usually admin/admin)

### Configuration via YAML

grizzle_e:
  host: YOUR_EVSE_IP_ADDRESS
  username: admin
  password: yourpassword
  scan_interval: 30  # Optional, in seconds
```

## Available Sensors

- **Current**: Current charging current (A)
- **Voltage**: Line voltage (V)
- **Power**: Current power draw (W)
- **Session Energy**: Energy used in current session (kWh)
- **Total Energy**: Total energy used (kWh)
- **Temperature 1/2**: Temperature sensors (°C)
- **State**:  state (Ready/Connected/Charging)
- **Pilot State**: EV connection status
- **RSSI**: WiFi signal strength (dBm)

## Troubleshooting: Verify EVSE Connectivity Outside of Home Assistant

If the integration fails, and the integreation is running in Home Assistant, but cannot connect to the Grizzl-E EVSE, first verify that you can access your Grizzl-E EVSE over the network **without** Home Assistant involved.

This check helps confirm that your network, credentials, and the EVSE are working correctly before adding any Home Assistant complexity.

### What you need

You will need:
- The **IP address** of your Grizzl-E EVSE
- The **username**
- The **password**
- Your computer and EVSE on the **same network** or the firewall rules to allow access

---

### Testing Connectivity

#### Step 1: Verify Web Interface Access

Verify that you can access the Grizzl-E EVSE's web interface with your regular web browser. The bottom of the page will show the EVSE Version, WiFi Version and Serial Number.


#### Step 2, option 1: Command line (macOS and Linux)

If you are comfortable using a terminal, you can test connectivity using `curl`, replacing `<username>`, `<password>`, and `<EVSE_IP>` with your actual values.

```bash
curl -sS -X POST -H 'Authorization: Basic '"$(printf %s '<username>:<password>' | base64)" http://<EVSE_IP>/main
```
There is also a way to do this with Windows PowerShell, but if you know how to initiate a network request like this in PowerShell, you know how to adapt a curl command.

#### Step 2, option 2: Using a graphical tool

If you are not comfortable using the command line, you can use a graphical HTTP client such as:

- **[Postman](https://www.postman.com/)** (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- **[Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/)**

##### Request details

- **Method:** `POST`
- **URL:** `http://<EVSE_IP>/main`
- **Body:** (empty)
- **Authentication:**
- Type: **Basic Authentication**
- Username: your EVSE username
- Password: your EVSE password

- **Headers:**
- No custom headers are required when using Basic Auth (the tool will add them automatically)

#### Expected result

If the request is successful, the EVSE will return a **JSON response** containing status information.

If you see JSON data, your IP address, username, and password are correct.
